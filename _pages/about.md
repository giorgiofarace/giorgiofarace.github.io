I'm a PhD student in [Political Economy](https://politicaleconomy.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

I am broadly interested in formal theory and comparative politics. I am currently working on models of information manipulation in non-democracy, repression, and collective choice.



# Work in progress

## Manipulated elections and citizen welfare

## Repression via collective punishment

## A general impossibility of social choice
